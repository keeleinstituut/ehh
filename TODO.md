# TODO List

- [ ] Refactor SCSS code to remove deprecated Sass features (e.g., `/` for division, outdated mixins). Check migration guide: https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes

- [ ] Fix failing Angular unit tests due to missing service dependencies. Mock required services using `TestBed.configureTestingModule()` and `spyOn()` where necessary.
